## S3 Simple Storage Service
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is AWS’s object storage service that lets you store and retrieve any amount of data over the internet.

S3 is AWS’s highly durable, scalable, and secure object storage service used to store files as objects inside buckets.

#### How it works
S3 = Object Storage
You store data as Objects inside Buckets.

Think of S3 like:
- A giant global file system
- But instead of folders/files, you have buckets/objects

S3 is not block storage like a hard drive.
It’s not a file system like EFS/EBS.
It’s object storage accessed over HTTP/HTTPS.

#### Buckets
A bucket is a top-level container in S3.
Important facts:
- Bucket names must be globally unique (no two buckets in AWS can have the same name).
- You choose one AWS region for the bucket.
- Buckets contain unlimited objects.
- Buckets are private by default.
- You can think of a bucket as a database table; a logical grouping of objects.

#### Objects
Objects = files stored in S3
Each object has:
- Data (the file itself)
- Metadata (content-type, encoding, tags)
- Object key (its name/path)
- Version ID (if versioning enabled)

Examples of objects:
- image.png
- videos/demo.mp4
- website/index.html
- data/report.csv
- backup/db-2024-12-01.sql

Objects can be any size from 0 bytes to 5TB.

#### Object keys (the "path")
object key = full path:
Ex: photos/2025/family/pic1.png
Even though it looks like folders, S3 has no real directories — just keys that contain /.
S3 is flat storage.

#### Versioning
Versioning allows S3 to keep multiple versions of the same object.
Example: 
- Upload image.png
- Upload new image.png
- Upload again

Each upload becomes a separate version with its own version ID.
Why it matters:
Protects against accidental overwrites or deletes
Used for backup and data recovery
Required for some lifecycle policies

Interview answer:
“Versioning lets S3 maintain all versions of an object. It protects against accidental deletion and overwriting.”

#### Public vs Private Access
S3 buckets are private by default.

✔ Private Access
Only the bucket owner or IAM users can read/write
Used for logs, internal data, backups, ML datasets

✔ Public Access
Anyone on the internet can view files
Used mainly for static website hosting or public assets

AWS has a block public access toggle on buckets to prevent accidental exposure.

“By default, S3 buckets block public access. To make files public, you must disable block-public-access and add a bucket policy or access control list.”

#### Permissions
3 ways to S3 controls access:
(1) IAM Policies (identity-based)
Define who can access S3 and what actions they can perform.
Example: Allow your IAM user to upload objects to a bucket

(2) Bucket Policies (resource-based)
Define how the bucket itself behaves.
Examples: Make the entire bucket public, Allow CloudFront to read objects, Deny all deletes

(3) ACLs (Access Control Lists)
Legacy — avoid unless required.

Interview answer:

“S3 access is controlled using IAM policies (identity-based), bucket policies (resource-based), and ACLs (legacy). Buckets are private by default, so explicit permissions are required to allow public access.”

#### S3 URLs
Each object has a unique URL:
Standard URL:
https://bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com/object-key

Region-specific:
https://bucket-name.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/object-key

Example:
https://mywebsiteassets.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/logo.png


If the object is private → you get “Access Denied”.
Public objects return instantly.
