# AWS Core Foundations

This repository is a **structured learning path for AWS core services**, designed for:
- Software Engineers (SWE)
- AI / ML Engineers
- Anyone preparing for **AWS-based technical interviews**

The repo combines **clear theory** with **hands-on practice guides**, covering real-world AWS workflows step by step.


## What to expect

By going through this repository, one can understand and practice:

- AWS Compute (EC2, ECS, Lambda)
- Networking (VPC, Subnets, Routing, Load Balancers)
- Storage (S3, ECR)
- Monitoring (CloudWatch)
- Data & ML Foundations (Glue, SageMaker)
- CLI-based AWS workflows
- End-to-end application deployment on AWS

This repository focuses on **core concepts** and **used in real production systems**.

## Where to Start

If you are new to AWS or want a **strong foundation**, follow this order:

### Step 1: AWS Fundamentals (Theory)
Start with the **Theory/** folder in this order:

1. `IAM.md`
2. `EC2.md`
3. `VPC.md`
4. `S3.md`
5. `CloudWatch.md`
6. `ALB.md`
7. `ECR.md`
8. `ECS.md`
9. `Lambda.md`
10. `Glue.md`
11. `SageMaker.md`

These files explain **what each service is, why it exists, and how it’s used in real systems**.

### Step 2: Hands-On Practice
After understanding the theory, move to **Practice/**:

1. `CLI_Commands.md`  
2. `EnteringOwnCloudServer.md`
3. `NetworkingPracticeVPC.md`
4. `ObjectStorage.md`
5. `StaticWebsiteAndCloudWatchPractice.md`
6. `DeployAppInTheCloud.md`

These guides walk through **AWS setups**.

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge
- AWS account (Free Tier is sufficient for most practice)
- Willingness to learn incrementally

Happy learning!
